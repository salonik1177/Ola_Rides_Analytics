# Ola Rides Analytics

# Project Background: 
The rapid growth of ride-sharing platforms has reshaped urban transportation by offering affordable, on-demand mobility solutions. OLA, as one of India’s leading ride-hailing services, generates massive volumes of operational data encompassing ride bookings, cancellations, pricing, vehicle performance, driver behaviour, and customer feedback.
This project leverages data analytics and visualization techniques to transform raw ride data into actionable business insights using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Streamlit.

# Executive Summary:
This project analyzes 103K+ OLA rides using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Streamlit to identify trends in ride demand, revenue, cancellations, and customer satisfaction. The analysis generated ₹35.08M in revenue insights, highlighted key cancellation drivers, and showed consistently high service ratings (avg 4.0).

# Business Problem:
Despite having access to large volumes of ride data, OLA faces challenges in converting raw data into actionable insights. Key business gaps include understanding peak demand patterns, identifying top revenue drivers across vehicle types and payment methods, analyzing the root causes of ride cancellations, and evaluating service quality through customer and driver ratings. Addressing these gaps is critical to improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer experience, and maximizing profitability.
